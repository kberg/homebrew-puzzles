Brew formulae for [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/)

    $ brew tap kberg/puzzles
    $ brew install --HEAD puzzles
    $ brew linkapps
    $ open -a Puzzles

Issues
------
  * `--HEAD` is required, but not pleasant, and is required because versioning is not automatically based on the repo version number.
